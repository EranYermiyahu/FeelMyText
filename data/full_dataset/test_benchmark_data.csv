Happy cake day friend,2
A hatred for loot boxes and a desire to get them banned was quite popular on Reddit.,1
"I buy VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. I have a huge collection.",6
How is it racist? I fail to see how.,0
"I think it's normal. Don't analyse how you look like and worry about it btw, those idiots sure don't when they say their bullshit",0
Um....Yes? I would love it if everyone didn't believe in [NAME].,0
Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.,3
She was 100% more likable on the tell-all than she was in the show. She may deserve that sweet husband of hers yet!,6
"Sad thing is, I wanted to, but I‚Äôm stupidly awkward...",4
"I'd love [NAME], boy can shoot",3
but the dayman doesn't have the nightman's sexy hands.,0
IIRC there is a Simpsons episode where [NAME] has programmed the emergency button on the phone to call the pizza place.,6

Dear [NAME]. What country is this?,6

Oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck RIGHT OFF!!!!!,0
"After how badly the Patriots screwed CT, how can anyone like them?",6
We‚Äôve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn‚Äôt rise to the level we warned him about.,1
You have to be trolling because I doubt you‚Äôre this dumb.,0
"Yeah, they are the dumb ones you need to avoid.",0
"He's shooting very efficiently, too. Most of his FGs scored at the rim.",2

Maybe one day but I am very cultured*,2

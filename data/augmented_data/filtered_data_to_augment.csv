"I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. ",1
But [NAME] is fine,3
I supported a third party lunatic. Huge difference.,4
Can't believe people like this actually exist.,5
We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.,4
If it was Central Transport you might of got lucky. Sometimes I wonder if they even hve doors on the trailers things go missing an awful lot,5
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.,0
"Ugh I did this at a work conference and ran straight into the guest speaker. The flashbacks are rough, probably for her too I imagine. ",4
There is no Mrs [NAME]. Unless you count his sister.,1
Cordovan in the mech with the loudspeaker really makes me smile. It is just so bonkers. I love it.,3
"Their roster just doesn’t work, sadly they didn’t realize it in time.",5

"I know, which is why I said it hasn't been referenced by any *living* characters on the show.",5
>I have always been fairly short (5'9) Is this supposed to be a joke.,5

Whaaaat? I thought it was a perfectly normal childhood disease that posed no threat whatsoever! Why is she scared?,5
"[NAME] has been really blunt about things lately, I love it.",3
I wish I loved anything the way [NAME] loves playing hockey,3
I never said anything. I’m just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the line. Decisions are bought not made.,5
"so blame porn not the conditions that pushed them to use it as to the point of an ""addiction"" got it. ",4
How is this a racism?,5
"I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.",4

I wanna see [NAME] too at the ASG too!! He gotta show that [NAME] Magic with [NAME] as teammate,3
I do this all the time and I have honestly never noticed.,5

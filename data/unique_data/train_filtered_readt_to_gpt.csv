Can genes be altered? I feel like I’ve heard something like this.,5

We didn't win in Alvalade even when they got 7th place. We just have some sort of block there,4
[NAME] man hope your luck changes soon. I’m sure they’ll patch it up in the future,3
"Hmm, I didn't notice that change ... will pay attention ..",5
I'm not sure the game is balanced with always having access to healing or bouncing from lane. Much harder to wear down a hero.,5
And that is what cognitive dissonance looks like. People do the craziest things when reality doesn't meet their expectations.,3
